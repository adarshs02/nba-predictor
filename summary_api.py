KEY PREDICTION FACTORS:
{llm_prompt_data['top_global_features']}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
Please provide a comprehensive analysis that includes:

1. **Prediction Rationale**: Explain why the model predicts {llm_prompt_data['predicted_winner_name']} to win with {llm_prompt_data['win_probability_percent']}% confidence.

2. **Team Comparison**: Compare the key strengths and weaknesses of both teams based on their recent performance metrics. Highlight which statistical areas give the predicted winner their advantage.

3. **Key Factors Analysis**: Discuss how the most important statistical factors (listed above) influence this prediction. Explain what these metrics tell us about each team's playing style and effectiveness.

4. **Strategic Insights**: Provide insights into what each team needs to do to win, potential game flow scenarios, and areas where the underdog could potentially upset the prediction.

5. **Home Court Advantage**: Consider the impact of {llm_prompt_data['home_team_name']} playing at home and how this might affect the outcome.

Ensure your response is detailed, analytical, and provides valuable insights for basketball fans and analysts. Minimum 200 words required.
